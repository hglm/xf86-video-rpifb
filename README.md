Experimental Xorg driver for Raspberry Pi

Note: This driver has more or less been superseded by new features in the xf86-video-sunxifb driver,
on which rpifb is based. xf86-video-sunxifb compiles/installs out-of-the-box on RPi hardware. It can be found
at https://github.com/ssvb/xf86-video-sunxifb.git.
