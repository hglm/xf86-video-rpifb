Experimental Xorg driver for Raspberry Pi (obsolete)

Note: This driver has been superseded by new features in the
xf86-video-sunxifb driver,on which rpifb was based.
xf86-video-sunxifb compiles/installs out-of-the-box on RPi hardware,
providing performance improvement in areas such as dragging windows
even without hardware acceleration. It can be found at
https://github.com/ssvb/xf86-video-sunxifb.git.
