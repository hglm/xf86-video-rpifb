xf86-video-rpi - experimental Xorg video driver for the Raspberry Pi

Based on xf86-video-sunxi, and on the Xorg fbdev driver.

Please submit bugs & patches to:

        https://github.com/hglm/xf86-video-rpifb

To compile, you will need to install a number of packages;

	apt-get install build-essential xorg-dev xutils-dev x11proto-dri2-dev
	apt-get install libltdl-dev libtool automake libdrm-dev

Compile by running:

	autoreconf -vi
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make

Note that might have to rerun autoreconf and configure after pulling in changes.
Failure to do may result in a crashing driver, and since undefined symbols
are not flagged during the compile process there may be no warning.

Then install:

	sudo make install

and copy the default xorg.conf subfile to the right location:

	cp xorg.conf /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-rpifb.conf

A man page is available (rpifb).

Note on the default Raspberry Pi window manager configuration used in Raspbian:

The default window manager configuration used by Raspbian seems to do a lot of
buffering and shadowing doesn't seems to use screen-to-screen blits directly when
dragging windows. That's why this operation is laggy even with the driver enabled.

To experiment with a more streamlined environment, create the file .xinitrc in
your home directory with the single line:

	openbox

This will start an uncustomized openbox environment in which, for example, dragging
windows more directly reflects the intrinsic graphic operation speed.
